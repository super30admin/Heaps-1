    Description: merge k sorted linked lists
    
    Time Complexity: O(n log k), n is total number of elements (all linked list together)
    Space Complexity: O(k), k is number of linked lists
    
    Approach: Use heapify to sort least value
    1. add all the first heads to a heap
    2. find minimum value by heappop, add to resulted list, and point to the next value in the list with min value
    3. repeat #2 until all the elements are popped and added to the result
