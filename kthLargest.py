215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Time Complexity: O(Kâˆ—logK+(Nâˆ’K)âˆ—logK), which is asymptotically equal to O(N*logK) where n = number of elements
Space Complexity : O(k) 

Approach: Heap
1. Create a min heap and store first k values in it
2. Go through the remaining numbers of the array, if the number from the array is bigger than the top(smallest) number of the min-heap, 
remove the top number from heap and add the number from array
3. Return the top most element in heap
