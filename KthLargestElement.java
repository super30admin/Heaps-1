// Time Complexity - O(nlogk) -- k is the size of heap and n is the total number of input -- log k is the time for insertion of each element into the heap and hence for n such elements we have nlogk
// Space Complexity - O(k) -- as we maintain a heap of size k
// Approach - we add k elements into the heap and for every k+1 th element we poll out the min element out and hence at the end of the jing bang we just use O(1) to get the root element from the heap which is our answer i.e. kth largest element or the min out of k elements as we are using min heap our root will be most minimum
