What is heap?
Heap is the data structure which is basically a complete binary tree. On the basis of how the data is stored heap can be categorized as min heap or max heap. 

It has following basic functions:
parent: i-1 // 2 where i is the index of element whose parent needs to be find.
left child: 2i + 1 where i is the index of element whose left child needs to be find.
right child: 2i + 2 where i is the index of element whose right child needs to be find.
leafNode: for n size heap, leaf nodes are at index i > n/2
add(): add element to the heap
remove(): remove element from the heap
heapify(): heap is generally implemented using array, heapify() is use to arranged the array elements in such a way that it will satisfy the heap data structure's criteria.

Min Heap:
parent < child and root node has the minimum value

Max Heap:
parent > child and root node has the maximum value

When to use heap:
Whenver we need to find the kth largest element or kth smallest element, then heap is useful.
